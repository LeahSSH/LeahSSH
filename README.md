## About Me

Hi! I’m Leah (also known as leah.ssh), a software developer who enjoys building clean, reliable, and maintainable systems. I care deeply about structure, performance, and making sure projects remain solid and easy to work with long-term.

Most of my work focuses on developing Discord bots and automation tools, creating FiveM scripts, and managing or customizing web platforms such as Invision Community. I enjoy breaking down complex systems and turning them into smooth, organized, and efficient solutions.

I’m detail-oriented, curious, and always learning—whether that means refining existing code, improving workflows, or experimenting with new ideas. My goal is to build tools that feel polished, thoughtful, and genuinely enjoyable to use.
